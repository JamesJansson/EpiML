Things that I want to achieve 
Done Implement for females
Done Implement the injecting across the multiple simulations
Optimisation of becoming regular and exiting IDU population
Adjust input values
	Randomise by a certain amount
	Increase by a factor for underreporting
Get the count statistic to work across multiple simulations
Get the parameter class to start accepting input values
	Create a standard parameter class set up
		HCV
		HIV
		ID
		Treatment
	Parameter class has an indicator that shows whether it has a 'values' vector or not
	Single value parameters
	Population distribution parameter
		Used for times, viral load counts etc
		Made up of two distribution parameters
		Population mean
		Standard deviation in the mean population estimates
		Standard deviation of individuals in the population
		Uncertainty in the individual uncertanty (optional)
		Displays 
			uncertainty of the mean
			Range of population values of the median estimate (e.g. Interquartile range)
		Standard types
			Normal
				Median
				SD of Median uncertainty (normally distributed in log)
				SD of population
				SD of SD of population uncertainty
			Exponential value distribution
			Exponential probability distribution
				Used to distribute times for constant probability events
	Proportion - a special parameter class that distributes across categories, 
		Each value in the proportion contains
			Estimate
			Uncertainty
		contains an optional normalisation factor
			Normalisation used for probabilities where the total must be equal to one or some fixed value
			Non-normalisation is used for situations in which you want a count with a total e.g. total people in a group
	Ratio factor - a special parameter class that copies all the properties of another distribution, but increases or decreases the mean by an amount
	A downloader that prints out all the parameters with information 
		Parameter type (e.g. normal, log normal)
		SD etc
		95% Uncertainty
Scenario blender
	Create a new parameter, e.g. a linear distribution
	This represents a range of values e.g. SofosbuvirUseIntervention =0%-100%
		Using a value like this, we can see what an intervention does to the results
			e.g. test extract results CostOfOfSofosbuvir and QALY
			Dividing one by the other, and plotting against intervention strength will show the cost effectiveness at what level of prescription
HCV mortality
	Fibrosis -> LF -> HCC
	
	
Estimates desired for the enquiry
	Number of people initiating IV drug use
	Number of people stopping
	Percentage stopping
	Safe injecting changes
	New HCV cases estimates
	
In PersonClass
	For each value of interest
		Update(Time, Person)
			Each individual Update() conatins instructions for what must be updated 
			Can be called recursively
				Updating HCVInfection requires an update of
