function AssignInjectingPopulation(){
	// first read in the population CSV

	// Rate of injecting mortality should be deducted from the overall population 
	// Use ABS reported rates of drug related mortality
	// The people who inject regularly get to use the NSP rates
	
	// Optimise to a constant rate, a peak, then a fall back to a constant rate
	// exponential + a normal distribution
	// A + k + mean + SD + A  
	// then start adding people until you reach a restriction

// Following the assignment of the population, the main idea is to establish the following parameters
// Rate of entry into injection
// Rate of people becoming regular users
// Rate that the regular users use
// Rate of leaving regular injection
