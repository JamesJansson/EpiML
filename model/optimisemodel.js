// Optimise individuals exitting the population with time

// Take the optimised results of the "ever" injectors



// Create a population based on these results
// Exit them out of the population if they don't become a regular injector
// Exit them out at a constant rate with time
// TimeUntilEvent(PerYearProbabilityOfCeasing)

// Get from the full model an number that corresponds to the number of diagnoses that occurred with time. 

// The error function contains
// A statistical extraction of the groups in data
// A comparison of those statistics with data
// A record of how many individuals could not be extracted for diagnosis

// This will likely be insufficient data. A record of prevalence in the injecting group will be needed
// A transition to
