// Math.random is platform dependent, meaning we need to create or use a platform independent method 
// This topic is discussed here http://bocoup.com/weblog/random-numbers/
// The code below was found here https://gist.github.com/Protonk/5367430
// LCG is the standard method used in many C++ compilers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Parameters_in_common_use 
		
// Linear congruential generator code found here:

// Usage:
// lcg.setSeed(34658437);
// RandomVariable=lcg.rand();
