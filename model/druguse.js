// Determine drug history
// The aim of this is to establish baselines at which drug use changes
// Firstly, a person becomes involved with drugs
// They go from being a once of tried to a regular users
// From there they become a frequent user
// Finally they may leave or OD

function DetermineDrugUse(Person, Year){
	// In this framework, drug use is independent of the network in which they use 


	// set when they first try
	// determine if they stop 
	// determine when they take more regularly

	// re calculate death
	
	// Below is an optimisation step
	// use an adjustable age based rate based on NSP
	// adjust to match population rates

function DrugNetwork(){
	// The first step is to determine when they become connected
	// Then we determine when people find connections 
		// more people as they become more experienced?
	// Then we determine who's connected this is hard
		// first start with a random network
		// Later implement the Margaret Hellard  model
