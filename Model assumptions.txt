Discussion about model structure

The fundamental assumption about this model that makes it different is two fold:
1) The most important element of deciding the outcome of a hepatitis C infection is age. 
2) The most important mode of transmission of hepatitis C in Australia is due to sexual partners sharing injecting equipment

The individual based structure of the model allows age related calculations to be performed accurately, a limitation of non-individual based modelling. 
Similarly, the sexual network modelling allows estimation of transmission speed in a way that is not possible in other models

Looking at needle sharing, in people who inject drugs, 20% shared needles in the previous month. 
Typically the needle was reused after a single person in 50-70% of cases.
The sexual partner was by far the most to share equipment with. Of reported sharing people over 1995 to 2010
Regular sexual partner 50.6%
Casual sexual partner 5%
Close friend 28%
Acquaintance 11%
Other 5.3% (which is likely to be family)



Inspection of Table 1.2.8 of the NSP show that people who have been injecting less than 3 years have a substantially reduced probability of being HCV 
For people who have been injecting more than 3 years, the likelihood of HCV antibody in people who haven't receptively shared in the last month is very close to the likelihood if they have shared in the last month.
This suggests that people who have not receptively shared in the last month are not always safe injectors, simply that they are safe more often.
In particular, those people who did not receptively share recently may have been receptively sharing at younger ages (due to power or age imbalance in relationships)
This power imbalance is also played out in the much higher prevalence in young females who inject drugs.






Given the low number of people who are who have never tested for HCV in the NSP population, it is expected that there are very few cases of undiagnosed HCV. 




Following optimisation, the testing rate of the system is determined. This is a multivariate testing rate that is dependent on stage of infection, age
