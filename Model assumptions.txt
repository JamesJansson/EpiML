Discussion about model structure

The fundamental assumption about this model that makes it different is two fold:
1) The most important element of deciding the outcome of a hepatitis C infection is age. 
2) The most important mode of transmission of hepatitis C in Australia is due to sexual partners sharing injecting equipment

The individual based structure of the model allows age related calculations to be performed accurately, a limitation of non-individual based modelling. 
Similarly, the sexual network modelling allows estimation of transmission speed in a way that is not possible in other models

Looking at needle sharing, in people who inject drugs, 20% shared needles in the previous month. 
Typically the needle was reused after a single person in 50-70% of cases.
The sexual partner was by far the most to share equipment with. Of reported sharing people over 1995 to 2010
Regular sexual partner 50.6%
Casual sexual partner 5%
Close friend 28%
Acquaintance 11%
Other 5.3% (which is likely to be family)
